//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as youâ€™d expect:
14 + 16 + 20
6 + 8 + 30
99000 - 30
//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
4 * 90
2 * 800
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
90 / 3
24 / 6
300 / 50
//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(20 + 60 + 90) / 2
(80 - 30 - 5) / 50
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
//: Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
//:
//: Next, learn how programmers can leave notes in code.
